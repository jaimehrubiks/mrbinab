Hi, my name is Jaime Hidalgo Garc√≠a and I am presenting you here a concept that will for sure be of utility for technological advance.
It is called  DHSAI [it stands for "Distributed Human Simulated Artificial Intelligence"] which in simple words can be described as a concept in which an AI entity is controlled by humans in a distributed way. At first it may sound a little bit awkward, why would you want to manually control or act for a robot (AI) when it actually means the opposite. Well there are many points that will likely change your mind.

* Psychological challenge: The fact that you can't be sure if you're interacting with a robot or with a human.
* AI learning: The previous experiment leads to an environment where AI can definitely learn from what they are not yet, humans.
* Distributed work and jobs: Manual work performed by robots, but mind-controlled by humans from their work spot. Advance of pre-robotics era.
* Much more.

Important clarification: It is not about persons controlling a robot. It is about persons acting as the brain of a robot, not his body.

## Mr. Binab [Telegram Bot]

Mr. Binab is a Telegram bot which is a "BOT who claims to be a human" when he is indeed a human. Awesome huh? It is written using Python using the library [telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot) written by "nickoala" (thanks for your sharing your library and for your fast support!) which is an interface to the Telegram Bot Api.
